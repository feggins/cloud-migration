With cloud adoption, you get rid of this capital expense. You only pay for what you are using and can add and release resources as per requirement. In other scenarios, when an organization is planning to extend capacity, it will bring more capital expenditure compared to the cloud.
Productivity Enhancement

Cloud adoption cuts down the lengthy asset procurement processes and thus, the end-user does not need to wait to get their infrastructure ready.

In addition, IT teams can access the cloud portfolio when and where needed, which can help them get rid of building data centers and maintaining hardware.


Business agility is the ease of delivering better products faster in response to customer demands. Cloud provides the ability to scale the infrastructure up and down depending on business needs. On-demand scalability helps organizations to pay only for what they are actually using.
